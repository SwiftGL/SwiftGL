# Swift Graphics Libraries

This is an Xcode project used to develop SwiftGL. 

If you are here to use the libraries, you can
[find them here](https://github.com/SwiftGL).
There are also [tutorials](http://swiftgl.org)
to get you started.

To use this Xcode project you must have GLFW3 installed. For homebrew,
`brew glfw3` does the trick.
